Overview
========

Embed user provided logo images into qr codes.

How it is used
==============

User provides:

- Logo image in PNG format

- URL to encode

and an SVG or PNG is generated with the logo embedded in the center of the qr code, eg: http://www.icezorg.com/wp-content/uploads/qrcode_adidas.gif

Configuration
=============

Size in pixels of qr code modules: 5x5, 7x7, 8x8, or 12x12


Behavior
========

- If a QR code square is overlapped by the logo image, and that square of the logo image contains any "non-empty" pixels, then the entire QR code square will be white, and that square of the logo image will be rendered on top of it.


Pseudocode
==========

- Generate the non-branded qr code array for that url (as returned by rQrCode, call this qrCodeMatrix.

- Generate the non-branded qr code image for that url, call this qrNonBrandedImg.

- Create a completely transparent image with same dimension as image created above.  

- Center the logo in the image created above, call this image qrLogoRawOverlayImg.

- Loop over every QR code square

  - Get sub-image in qrLogoRawOverlayImg which corresponds to that QR code square, call this subregionQrLogo

  - Does every pixel in subregionQrLogo have alpha=0? 

    - Yes: do nothing

    - No: modify appropriate square in qrCodeMatrix and force it to be white

- Generate a new version of the non-branded qr code image for that url, taking into account modifications to qrCodeMatrix, call this qrNonBrandedFinalImg.

- Overlay qrLogoRawOverlayImg on top of qrNonBrandedFinalImg yielding the final result.

Limitations
===========

- Only will support one size of QR code.  

- Provided logo image must be correct size, no checking

TODO
====

- Allow user to specify number of whitespace squares to surround logo with (default=0)

- Specify color of dark squares
